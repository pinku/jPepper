jPepper
=======

What's jPepper? jPepper is a small and fast javascript library for DOM manipultation.

I always use jQuery, I'm a big fan of jQuery, but some months ago, during a project that requires performance,
I found that jQuery in some cases is not so performant. 
So I started writing my own library and that's is, this is jPepper.
